The code that you will use to complete this will be similar to the sunspots example from the course module.  This data set contains two columns: *time* and *value*.  Create a LSTM network and train it with a sequence size of 5 and a prediction window of 1.  If you use a different sequence size, you will not have the correct number of submission rows. Train the neural network, the data set is fairly simple and you should easily be able to get a RMSE below 1.0.
